Biore Deep Cleansing Pore Strips leave skin feeling cleaner with visibly smaller pores after continuous use. A dermatologist-tested way to remove blackheads and purify pores.","Important information
Safety Information

For external use only. Avoid contact with eyes.

Ingredients

Polyquaternium-37, Silica, Water, Glycerin, Polysilicone-13, PEG-12 Dimethicone, Aluminum Hydroxide, Butylene Glycol, Stearyl Glycyrrhetinate, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Leaf Extract, Titanium Dioxide.

Directions

How to use: 1. Remove strip from pouch. Twist strip to loosen and separate slits prior to use (see illustration). 2. After washing your face, thoroughly wet your nose. The strip won't stick on a dry nose. 3. Dry hands. Peel strip off plastic liner. Apply to nose area, smooth side down, pressing down to ensure good contact with skin. 4. Let dry for about 10-15 minutes until stiff to the touch - like papier-mâché. 5. Slowly and carefully peel off starting at edges, pulling toward center.","Brand        Bioré | Item Form        Strips | Product Benefits        Anti Acne, Oil Control, Pore Cleansing, Pore Reduction | Scent        Citrus | Material Type Free        Oil Free",,,"Is Discontinued By Manufacturer
